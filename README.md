## **Introduction**

RoboRally is a two-player game where robots navigate a grid filled with **boosters**, **obstacles**, and strategic elements. Players aim to reach a **flag cell** before their opponent by choosing movement commands, using power-ups, and avoiding dangers. The game showcases the integration of **OOP principles** and **GUI-based interaction**, creating a fun and educational experience.

## **Features**

- **Two Game Modes**:
  - **Design Mode**: Customize the game grid by adding objects like flags, belts, danger zones, water pits, and more.
  - **Play Mode**: Compete against another player to reach the flag while interacting with game objects and using strategic moves.
- **Grid Mechanics**:
  - Supports a 5x11 grid with numbered cells (1-55).
  - Game objects include flags, belts, danger zones, workshops, antennas, water pits, and rotating gears.
- **Player Interactions**:
  - Health-based command system: Players with higher health can execute more moves per turn.
  - Strategic shooting phase: Robots fire lasers at each other in the same row or column.
  - Workshop upgrades: Purchase weapons, consumables, and devices like lasers or shields.
- **Graphics**:
  - GUI-based interaction with toolbars, command bars, and status updates.
  - Visual representation of players, grid objects, and commands.

## **Game Modes**

### **1. Design Mode**
- Add, edit, or remove game objects on the grid.
- Save and load grid configurations for future use.
- Supported objects:
  - **Flag**: Destination cell for the game.
  - **Belts**: Move robots between cells.
  - **Water Pits**: Instantly destroy robots.
  - **Danger Zones**: Reduce robot health.
  - **Workshops**: Repair robots and purchase upgrades.
  - **Rotating Gears**: Rotate robots by 90°.

### **2. Play Mode**
- Players navigate their robots on the grid using movement commands:
  - **Move Forward**, **Move Backward**, **Rotate Left**, **Rotate Right**.
- Commands are randomly generated and limited by player health.
- Robots interact with grid objects during movement and engage in strategic battles.
